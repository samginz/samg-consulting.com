    <h2>About SG Consulting</h2>
    <p>
        SG Consulting helps growing organizations uncover hidden inefficiencies, redesign workflows, and build simple,
        reliable systems around the way they actually operate, not the way a slide deck says they should.
    </p>
    <p>
        With experience spanning operations leadership, IT, and risk and insurance, we bridge strategy and execution.
        That means you get clear analysis, realistic recommendations, and hands-on support to implement changes
        without overwhelming your team.

    <div class="services">
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Operational Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Department by department reviews to map workflows, quantify waste, and identify quick wins as well
                as structural issues. You get a clear picture of what is slowing you down and what to fix first.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Process Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                Redesign tasks, handoffs, and approvals to reduce duplication, close gaps, and improve accountability.
                We build simple SOPs and KPI dashboards so you can monitor performance and keep improvements in place.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Automation and Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Select and implement tools, dashboards, and automations that remove manual work without creating
                complexity. From spreadsheets and Access to cloud platforms and integrations, we work within
                the tools you already use where possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
            <h3>Hands-On Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                We do not stop at the recommendation stage. We work with your staff, vendors, and partners to put
                new processes into production, train users, and adjust until the system is stable and self sustaining.

        <div class="why-item">
            <h3>Simple and practical solutions</h3>
            <p>
                We aim for the smallest change that delivers a meaningful result. In many cases we start with process
                and basic tools before recommending heavy platforms or complex systems.

        <div class="why-item">
            <h3>Flexible engagement</h3>

                From short assessments to deeper implementation projects, we tailor the scope to your size, budget,
                and urgency, and we stay involved as needed to make sure changes stick.
